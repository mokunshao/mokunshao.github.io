You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```d
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

```html
<div id="archives">
{% for category in site.categories %}
  <div class="archive-group">
    {% capture category_name %}{{ category | first }}{% endcapture %}
    <div id="#{{ category_name | slugize }}"></div>
    <p></p>
    
    <h3 class="category-head">{{ category_name }}</h3>
    <a name="{{ category_name | slugize }}"></a>
    {% for post in site.categories[category_name] %}
    <article class="archive-item">
      <h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{post.title}}</a></h4>
    </article>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
</div>
```
